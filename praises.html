            When you smile or laugh, it‚Äôs like magic. Your smile is the most amazing thing, and your eyes are the most beautiful ones that i can ever see. Everything about you is perfect, from the way your hair shines to your cute cheeks and that adorable little mark on your lip. You are simply perfect.
            
            Just seeing your face can make my stress disappear. I dream about holding your hands, watching you sleep peacefully, and just being there to admire how wonderful you are. I want to make you breakfast, show you my love in every little way, and shower you with kisses on your cheeks, hands, and everywhere else.</h3></div>
